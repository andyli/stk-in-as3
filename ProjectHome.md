This is a port of the open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis library [The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)](http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/) (4.3.1).
<br />
<br />
Note that it is still being ported in progress, so is not suitable for production use.
<br />
However, anyone want to join and help is welcomed and please contact [Andy Li](mailto:andy@onthewings.net).
